# Optimize-Jim-Beam-Brands-Product-Portfolio-in-Iowa-Area
I used the dataset - Iowa Liquor Sale to recommend Jim Beam Brands what they could do with their product portfolio

About the Dataset:

This dataset contains the spirits purchase information of Iowa Class “E” liquor licensees by product and date of purchase from January 1, 2012 to current.

There are total 25.1 million rows with 24 columns, each row is a individual product purchase.

You can find it on Bigquery public dataset or access the same via the link:

About My Work:

Data extraction, process and analyzing is done by Google Bigquery. As I used free version of Bigquery, you might find the data cleaning process is not normal as the DML is not available in free version.

Visualization: Microsoft Power BI
